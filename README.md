# SMP Essentials
This is a simple pack created that has a few of my favorite mods for multiplayer. These mods are all server side, and most servers should allow them. Make sure to check you server's rules before using them! 

## Mods Used:
[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)  
[Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)  
[Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity)  
[Fullbright](https://modrinth.com/mod/fullbright)  
[Xaero's World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map)  
[Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) (Requires the mod to be installed server side to work, but I included it as many servers do have it already.)  
[Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)  
## Resource Packs Included:
[Bare Bones](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/bare-bones)  
[Bare Bones - Connected Glass](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/bare-bones-connected-glass)  
[Bare Bones - Better Leaves](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/bare-bones-better-leaves)  
[Outlined Ores](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/ore-outlines)  
None of these texture packs are enabled by default, you can enable them if you want to.
