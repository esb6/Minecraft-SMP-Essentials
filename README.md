This is a simple pack created that has a few of my favorite mods for multiplayer. These mods are all server side, and most servers should allow them. Make sure to check your server's rules before using them! It is also designed for performance.

Benchmarks:
On Donut SMP without Pack at spawn: 60-90 FPS
Same server with pack: 100-160 FPS
This is done on a crappy laptop on purpose to show its potential.
